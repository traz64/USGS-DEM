- This program contains a USGS DEM file parser and renderer
- Probably doesn't work with Alaska DEM files
- Untested with weird coordinate systems
- Does not account for curvature of earth
- The code is appropriately commented to document functionality of its components
- This program requires Qt 5.7 and is setup to be opened in Qt creator but can be used in
  Visual Studio with some modification
- I have included binaries in addition to the source code for ease of use if you don't have
  access to Qt creator
- I also included the test DEM we used to help develop the program
